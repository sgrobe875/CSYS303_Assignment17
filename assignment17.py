# Basic methodology: function which takes in n
# Use n to determine the bounds of the hexagon (n on each side)
# --> maybe find the center and work back from there?
# --> find the vertices of the hexagon
# working up from the bottom, determine algorithm for number of points in each row
# space that number of points evenly (np.linspace?)
# to build the adjacency list, use networkx! 
# assign coordinates to each node/point 
# build the adjacency list
# --> neighbor = any node within distance 1 of the given node (this might be tricky)
# --> for now/to get the required output, assume connection b/w all neighbors
